# Air_tax_HSR

 The data analysis, figure and table output were realised using R (that can be downloaded at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
 
 In order to replicate the table and figures:
 1. Download the whole repository Air_tax_HSR (it may take some time because of the size of the "data" folder).
 2. Execute the "main.r" file. At the beginning of this script, one has the option to load "df.final.Rdata" with the line "load("workspace_save/df_final.Rdata")", or to replicate the process of the data cleaning and treatment calling the script "database.R".
